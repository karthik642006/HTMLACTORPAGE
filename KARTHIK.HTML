<p>Hi Karthik! Since I donâ€™t know much about you yet, Iâ€™ll start with some general positive vibes: 

    Youâ€™ve got a name thatâ€™s rich in culture and history, often associated with wisdom, leadership, and creativity. If youâ€™re named after the Hindu deity Kartikeya, you might have a natural flair for courage and adventure. Youâ€™re also probably someone whoâ€™s thoughtful, curious, and eager to learnâ€”just like you are right now, asking for something uplifting!
    
    If you tell me more about yourself, like your interests, hobbies, or what youâ€™re passionate about, I can make it even more personal. ðŸ˜Š</p>
